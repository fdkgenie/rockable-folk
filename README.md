## What is `Rockable`?

Rockable is a DEM code written in C++ by <vincent.richefeu@3sr-grenoble.fr>. The two main specificities of the code are (_i_) to hold sphero-polyhedral shapes, (_ii_) to manage breakable interfaces. It is developed for an **academic usage**. This means that the code is not intended to be a tool for all purposes. It can easily be used to do what it is designed for, but to extend it, it is necessary to master both the model (DEM, complex shapes and interaction laws) and its implementation (data structure). The benefit of a good understanding is to avoid a "hacking" that would eventually limit the developped possibilities. In other words, the design of the code (neither too specific nor too general) is intended to avoid any tendency towards a single thought.

The program uses very few (if any) third-party libraries. The calculation code itself is self-sufficient. It relies only on a few small "headers-only" libraries embedded in the folder `common`. On the other hand, the 3D visualization software (`see`) uses the OpenGL programming interface.

The use of the code is not interfaced by any tool (like lua, python or any graphical interface) to facilitate its use, except the input format as described [here](https://richefeu.gitbook.io/cdm/dem/format-of-configuration-files-conf-files). This makes it particularly streamlined and greatly facilitates its integration with other calculation codes. It is in this sense that Rockable is quaified of academic code.
