## What is `Rockable`?  

Rockable is a DEM code written in C++ by <vincent.richefeu@3sr-grenoble.fr>. The two main specificities of the code are (_i_) to hold sphero-polyhedral shapes, (_ii_) to manage breakable interfaces. It is developed for an **academic usage**. This means that the code is not intended to be a tool for all purposes. It can easily be used to do what it is designed for, but to extend it, it is necessary to master both the model (DEM, complex shapes and interaction laws) and its implementation (data structure). The benefit of a good understanding is to avoid a "hacking" that would eventually limit the developed possibilities. In other words, the design of the code (neither too specific nor too general) is intended to avoid any tendency towards a single thought.

The program uses very few (if any) third-party libraries. The calculation code itself is self-sufficient. It relies only on a few small "headers-only" libraries embedded in the folder `common`. On the other hand, the 3D visualization software (`see`) uses the OpenGL programming interface.

The use of the code is not interfaced by any tool (like lua, python or any graphical interface) to facilitate its use, except the input format as described [here](https://richefeu.gitbook.io/cdm/dem/format-of-configuration-files-conf-files). This makes it particularly streamlined and greatly facilitates its integration with other calculation codes. It is in this sense that Rockable is qualified of "academic code".

## Folders

* `common`: header-only libraries used by Rockable or processing tools. This is now replace by the library `toofus` that can be found on [GitHub](https://richefeu.github.io/toofus/).
* `doc`: place to generate the doxygen html documentation of the source files of Rockable
* `sphinxdoc`: user documentation (sphinx with ReStructuredText)
* `examples`: examples for usage tutorials or for testing features
* `prepro`: some pre-processing tools
* `src`: Rockable C++ source files
* `test`: Rockable regression test files
* `deps`: Source files for Rockable dependencies
* `BUILD`: Compilation files of the code
* `INSTALL:` Binaries of Rockable routines

## Credits

Then, the breakable interfaces have been implemented during the PhD work of _Marta Stasiak_. A number of improvements have been added at that time thanks to intensive review with _Gael Combe_, Laboratoire 3SR.

New functionalities are being studied thanks to new collaborations of people from CEA, IATE and CNRS. For example, _Lhassan Amarsid_ (CEA) is working on the introduction of periodic boundary conditions, and multi-processor computing with domain decomposition. _Farhang Radjai_ and students, may introduce new breakable interfaces with energy-based criteria.

## Features

* **Particle Shapes:** the code uses only one 3D shape: sphero-polyhedra or R-shapes. These shapes can be non-convex (with holes if necessary) and have rounded edges and corners (uniform radius per shape). Some other shapes are currently considered for special boundary shapes (sphere, cylinderâ€¦) and specifique loadings.

* **Boundary Conditions:** any rigid element can be used to apply boundary conditions. It is possible to impose velocity, force, or moment component by component. Some predefined systems with servo-control are also available for complex loading conditions (e.g., loading cycles or controlled pressure).

* **Parallel Computation:** currently, an OpenMP optimization using compilation flags has been implemented.

## How to install

The source code can be cloned from github repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/richefeu/rockable.git
```

Using your OS package manager (yum, apt, brew etc) you will need to install several package before compiling: `glfw3`, `opengl`,`freeglut`, `libpng2` (optionnal).


If you are lucky, the compilation is as simple as:

```
bash install_rockable.sh
```

The compilation is done in the `BUILD` directory and the binaries go to the `INSTALL` directory.

Then, if needed, you can manage compilation options (profiling with MATools, full fetch of dependencies, see compilation, prepro compilation etc) using ccmake:

```
cd BUILD
ccmake .
# Set up options + `c` + `e` + `g`
cmake ..
make -j
make install 
```
The options available are listed below:

* `ROCKABLE_USE_FT_CORR` (default is OFF): add objectivity correction to tangent forces.
* `ROCKABLE_ENABLE_PROFILING` (default is ON): enable time profiling.
* `ROCKABLE_ENABLE_BOUNDARY` (default is OFF): enable the special boundaries like Ball or Cylinder.
* `ROCKABLE_ENABLE_SOFT_PARTICLES` (default is OFF): enable straining of particles.
* `ROCKABLE_ENABLE_PERIODIC` (default is OFF): enable full periodic boundary conditions.
* `ROCKABLE_COMPILE_SEE` (default is ON): compile the application to visualize the conf-files.
* `ROCKABLE_COMPILE_SEE3` (default is OFF): compile the application to edit graphically the input files
* `ROCKABLE_COMPILE_CONF2VTK` (default is OFF): compile the application to convert .conf into .vtk file to visualize results with paraview
* `ROCKABLE_COMPILE_POSTPRO` (default is OFF): compile the application for postprocessing the results
* `ROCKABLE_COMPILE_PREPRO` (default is OFF): compile the aplications to generate inputs for the code

## How to run a simulation

Before runing rockable you will need to source rockable environnement to add the INSTALL directory to your standard binaries PATH:
```
source Env_rockable.sh
``` 

To run a simulation, a configuration file has to be written. The format of such a file is described in the documentation. We show here a simple example simulating a sphere bouncing on a plan.

Then you can launch Rockable using:
```
rockable input.txt
```

If the executable has been compiled with openMP libraries, you can set the number of threads with the option `-j`:
```
rockable -j 8 input.txt
```

The verbosity of logs can be managed:
```
rockable -v 6 input.txt 
```
Highest number corresponds highest verbosity. `6: trace`, `5: debug`, `4: warn`, `3: warn`, `2: err`, `1: critical`, `0: off`

If the files produced by a computation (conf*, kineticEnergy.txt, perf.txt, and staticBalance.txt) have to be deleted, rockable can do the job.
```
rockable -c
```

## Visualising the simulations

Normally, the application `see` has been built as the same time than rockable: 
```
see conf100
```

If compiled the application `see3` is also available: 
```
see3 conf100
```
It allows to edit confs interactively

## Some envisioned features

- should have a look at [tinyexpr](https://github.com/codeplea/tinyexpr) so that the user can provide some custom expressions
- processing application could be written using [libcmdf](https://github.com/ronen25/libcmdf)
- https://github.com/p-ranav/indicators
